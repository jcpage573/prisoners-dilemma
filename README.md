# Prisoner's Dilemma Game

The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic game theory scenario where two players must choose between cooperation and betrayal. Each player makes their choice without knowing the other's decision, leading to different outcomes based on the combination of their choices.

## Point Tradeoffs

|               | Cooperate (Player B) | Betray (Player B)   |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Cooperate (Player A)** | Both: 3 points         | Player A: 0 points, Player B: 5 points |
| **Betray (Player A)**    | Player A: 5 points, Player B: 0 points | Both: 1 point         |

## How to Play

1. Each player secretly chooses to either cooperate or betray.
2. Reveal both players' choices simultaneously.
3. Points are awarded based on the combination of choices, as shown in the table above.
4. Repeat the process for a set number of rounds to see which player accumulates the most points.
